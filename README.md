# GDrive-Clone
Used React.js, React Hooks, React router, Firebase, Bootstrap and Auth to use features like sign up, log in, authentication, upload files and folders.
Gained knowledge about Components and Lifecycle as well.

•	Authentication: Used firebase authentication for user sign up of non-existing user and login for existing user. Accepts password, username and profile picture from non-existing user and stores in firestore database. Images and other media are stored in firebase storage while user credentials are stored in firestore. 

•	Routing: Used react-router-dom for routing between login page, sign up page and news feed. Intersection-Observer-API (Auto play): Whenever a video comes into view it starts playing and on exiting the view video stops. An observer is attached to watch target element i.e. videos. 

•	Add Video: Stores the video uploaded from user to firebase storage. 

•	Like/Comment: Used react states to keep count of number of likes and then store that in the firestore database. And similarly added user comments in the firestore database for a particular post
